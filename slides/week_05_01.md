#FEWD - Functions

###Ryan Lynch

##What you'll be able to do.

* Write, call, and use functions to perform specific tasks.
* Use arrays to store lists of values.
* Loop over arrays to perform tasks for each value.
* Write objects that contain properties and access those properties.
* Generate HTML in JavaScript using values in arrays and objects.

##Functions

* A function is a block of code that performs some task.
* We call the statements in the block the "body" of the function.
* The statements in the body are not run until the function is "called" or "invoked".

##Functions Syntax

##Function Calls

* We can refer to a function just like a variable using its name.
* We "call" or tell a function to run by following the name with parenthesis.

![](../../img/unit_2/function_calls.png)


##Function Arguments

* What do the parenthesis do?
* When we call a function, we can tell it to use certain values called "arguments".
* This allows us to run the same code multiple times with different conditions.

##Function Return Values

* Variables that are declared inside a function can only be referred to inside the function.
* So, if we want to get some value from the function we can return value.
* A function call is like any other expression, and the value is the return of the function.


##Function Return Values

```javascript
function addOne(value) {
	return value + 1;
}

var myNum = addOne(1);

console.log(myNum);
```


##Organizing Function 

* Because JavaScript is weird, it doesn't actually matter where you define a function or a variable.
* Generally, it's nice to organize all your code, including the body of a function like so:

```javascript
// Variable definitions first
var myName = 'Ryan';

// Then function definitions
function generateUsername(value) {
	return 'Robo' + value;
}

// Then do something with them
console.log('Your username is: ', generateUsername(myName));
```



##Arrays

* Sometimes we want to represent a list of values.
* For example, a list of names or a list of blog post titles.
* There is a special type of value for storing these lists called arrays.


##Arrays

```javascript
// We define an array using square brackets
// and separate the values in the list using commas
var gaPeoples = ['Ryan', 'Wade', 'Nicole', 'Pat'];

// Then we can reference the values by their position
// in the list. This is called the "index", and it starts
// from 0 instead of 1 (sort of confusing the 0th time you see it).
console.log(gaPeoples[0] + ' is number 0 at GA!');
console.log(gaPeoples[1] + ' is number 1 at GA!');
```

##Loops

* Sometimes there is some operation that we want to do multiple times.
* For example, in the Rock Paper Scissors game we want to play it multiple times.
* The most common type of loop we'll use is called a "for loop".
* Like an if statement or a function, a loop defines a block of code to be run each time.


##For loop

```javascript
var gaPeoples = ['Ryan', 'Wade', 'Nicole', 'Pat'];
var html = '<h1>Ga Peoples</h1><ul>';

// A for loop has three statements:
// 1) A starting condition for the loop
// 2) The condition that says when the loop is done.
// 3) An action to take each time the loop is run

for (var counter = 0; counter < gaPeoples.length; counter++) {
	html += '<li>' + gaPeoples[counter] + ' is number ' + 
		counter + ' at GA!' + '</li>';
}

html += '</ul>';

document.body.innerHTML = html;
```

##Objects

* An object is a collection of variables and functions.
* You've already been using objects built into the browser.
* The `document` and dom elements returned by `getElementById` are examples of objects.
* We can also create our own objects to store our own data.


##Objects

```javascript
// We declare an object using curly braces. Objects have properties, 
// just like real world things. Each has a variable name, and a value.
var person = {
	firstName: 'Ryan', 
	lastName: 'Lynch',
	hobby: 'biking',
	job: 'programmer'
};

var html = '<h1>About ' + person.firstName + '</h1>';
html += '<p>';
html += person.firstName + ' ' + person.lastName + ' is a person. ';
html += 'He likes ' + person.hobby;
html += ', but for his day job he is a ' + person.job;
html += '</p>';

document.body.innerHTML = html;
```
