##Box Model

Every element in web design is a box.

##Box Model

* Width = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right
* Height = height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom

##Tags & Boxes



##Document Object Model (DOM)

* When we look at code, we talk about tags.
* When we talk about a page in the browser, we talk about elements.
* These element exist in the browser in the DOM.


##DOM Tree

* The easiest way to picture the DOM is as a tree.
* Tags inside a tag become child elements of a parent element.
* Tags inside of the children become descendants of the parent element.

##DOM Tree

* Lets focus on the content elements contained in the body.
* We know how to select elements of a type using CSS.
* We can also select elements based on how they appear in the DOM.

##Nested Selectors

```css
p {
	/* declarations */
}
```

##Nested Selectors

```css
ul p {
	/* declarations */
}
```

##Nested Selectors

```css
p a {
	/* declarations */
}
```

##Nested Selectors

```css
p > a {
	/* declarations */
}
```

##Multiple Selectors

```css
p > a, ul p {
	/* declarations */
}
```

##Let's get specific...

* Selecting every paragraph or some paragraphs is fine.
* What if we want to style particular paragraphs?
* What if we want to add the same style to different types of elements?
* In addition to tag selectors, we can create custom selectors using Classes.


##Classes
* First we need to tell the browser that some elements are special.
* We do this using the `class` attribute.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<!-- Here we apply a class to a p tag -->
		<p class="highlight">Here is some highlighted text</p>
	</body>
</html>
```


##Classes

* Once we've applied the attributes, we can select those elements in css like so:

```css
/* A class selector */
.highlight {
	color: rgb(255, 255, 0);
}
```


##ID's

* In addition to classes, elements can also be identified by an ID attribute.
* These are useful for JavaScript, but it's bad practice to use them in CSS.
* Just the same, here is what the thing you shouldn't do looks like:

```css
#some-specific-name {
	display: none;
}
```


##Classes and ID's

* Classes are not unique, so we can apply the same class to multiple elements, even different types of elements.
* ID's are unique, so a particular id should only be applied to a single element.
* An element can have multiple classes, so we can separate different styles and apply them individually.
* Elements can have both an id and a set of classes.


##Classes and ID's

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p class="highlighted very-important">
			Some very important highlighted text.
		</p>
		<p id="something-specific" class="very-important">
			Some specific very important text that's not highlighted.
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

```css
.highlighted {
	color: rgb(255, 255, 0);
}

.very-important {
	font-size: 18px;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```


##Classes and ID's

* When an element has multiple classes, we can combine class selectors.
* Element selectors and class / id selectors can also be combined.

```css
.highlighted.very-important {
	border-bottom: 1px solid blue;
}

p.very-important {
	padding: 20px;
}
```


##Good Class Names

* There are as many way's to name classes as there are front-end developers.
* Here are two ways to structure things that work well together.


##Module Based Class Names

* First, you can name some classes based on how the styled elements function in the page.
* These should be general and high level, not something like `second-div-in-page`.
* This makes it clear where the styles should be applied in the page.
* The danger here is creating a bunch of specific classes that repeat common styles.

```css
.content
.content-title
.search-container 
.search-input
```


##Helper Classes

* Second, you can name some classes based on what styles they apply.
* These should be used to apply common styles to prevent repetition.
* The danger here is creating a bunch of classes for every concievable style.
* The key is to balance the two approaches.

```css
.float-right
.float-left
.clear-both
.danger
.warning
.success
.font-black 
.font-blue
```


##DRY and WET

* DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) is a core programming principle.
* WET (**W**rite **E**verything **T**wice) is what you want to avoid.
* Keep your CSS DRY!
