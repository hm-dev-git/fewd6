#FEWD - Layout, HTML5 elements & More CSS

###Ryan Lynch

Front-End Developer at IT.com



##What will I be able to do?

* Follow a process to develop an idea into a webpage.
* Utilize box sizing along with the box model to size elements.
* Understand the different types of boxes and how they appear in the page.
* Determine the function of elements on a page and use the appropriate tags.
* Use pseudo selectors to further refine styling and add interactivity.
* Evaluate how elements are positioned on a page, and apply the appropriate styles.



##Review

* Using class names based on function and based on style.
* Being descriptive with class names.
* Using HTML5 elements where appropriate.
* Box Model over line breaks (`<br>`).



##Final Projects

HTML Requirements

* Use HTML5 structural elements (header, footer, nav, section).
* Demonstrate correct use of classes and IDs.
* Select appropriate tags to markup content.
* Demonstrate proper coding style (indentation).


##Final Projects

CSS Requirements

* Apply fonts, colors, borders, and anything else you can dream up.
* Utilize positioning and the box model.
* Demonstrate proper coding style (indentation).


##Final Projects

JavaScript Requirements

* Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your webpage.
* We'll go over this more when we cover JS.
* For now, think about what you can't do with CSS and HTML.


##Final Projects

What isn't a requirement

* How "good" your website looks.
* The UX of your website.
* Whether or not your site is responsive.


##Final Projects

Milestones

* **Week 4 - Week 5**: Project Proposal.
* **Week 5**: Create wireframes for how your webpage will look.
* **Week 7**: Describe in plain english what you want your JavaScript to do.
* **Week 8**: First draft of your final project.



##How to Start

Markup

* What are the elements in the page and how are the functioning?
* What tags do I use to reflect the structure of the page?
* From the beginning, think about how the structure will work on smaller screens.


##How to Start

Style

* What are the fonts, colors, borders, ect.?
* How are elements positioned on the page?
* How will all these change when the screen size changes?


##How to Start

Interactivity

* Don't make the mistake of doing everything with JavaScript.
* Think in plain english, realize that with code.


##How to Start

Iterations

* Don't think you have to do everything at once.
* Break down what you want to do into specific tasks.
* Create goals for what tasks you want to do first.
* Create versions of your project, evaluate, repeat.



##Reset CSS

* Before we start to style a page, some styles have already been applied.
* Browsers have different default styles for various elements.
* Reset CSS applies common styling to elements across browsers.

```html
<link 
	href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/3.0.1/normalize.css" 
	rel="stylesheet"
>
```



##CSS Precedence

* This is a complex topic, and one that could take an entire class.
* I'm going to have you read [this](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/27/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/) article outside of class.
* When reading, ignore the advice about ID selectors...we don't use ID selectors in CSS.
* It introduces some new selectors and selector combinations that you don't have to know.
* It will be confusing, and you will have questions. Please ask them.



##Box Sizing

* Remember the box model?
* There are two ways that the browser can measure the size of an element.

![](http://www.mandalatv.net/itp/drivebys/css/lib/img/box_model.gif)


##Box Sizing - Content Box

* This is the default sizing model used by the browser.
* The size of the element does not include the padding and border.


##Box Sizing - Border Box

* This sizing model can be specified via CSS.
* The size of the element includes the padding and border.

```css
p {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}
```


##Box Sizing - Which do you use?

* With the content box model you'll probably end up doing a lot of math.
* The border box model is more intuitive, so you'll use it most of the time.



##Display Property

* Everything in CSS is a box, but there are different types of boxes.
* We specify which box using the `display` property.
* All these different types of boxes follow the box model.


##Display Property

`display: none`

* Don't display it at all, so no box.

```css
.hidden {
	display: none;
}
```


##Display Property

`display: inline`

* These elements behave like text in a paragraph.
* They get laid out in a line from left to right, and wrap.
* You can change their content height using the `line-height` style.
* You can't set their width with a style.
* Anchor tags are examples of inline elements.


##Display Property

`display: block`

* Block elements by default take up the full width available to them
* This changes depending on other styles however.
* They implicitly have a line break before and after them.
* You can set their height and width explicitly using `height` and `width`.
* Navs and Paragraphs are examples of block elements.


##Display Property

`display inline-block`

* Sometimes your feel like a block, sometimes you don't.
* Gets laid out left to right like an inline element.
* You can set it's height and width like a block.
* Doesn't wrap like an inline element.
* Doesn't have implicit line breaks like a block.


##Display Property

* We can apply these styles to any element we want.
* So a nav can be displayed inline, or an anchor can be a block.



##New Elements!

Divs

* Think of a `div` tag as the most basic, unstyled block element.
* You can put whatever you want in it, and style it any way you choose.
* Not everything should be a div though.
* Prefer sematically correct elements over divs where appropriate.

```html
<div>
	Help! I'm trapped in a div!
</div>
```


##New Elements!

Spans

* Think of a `span` tag as the most basic, unstyled inline element.

```html
<span>Look at me, I'm a span!</span>
```


##New Elements!

Some obvious HTML5 Elements

* **Nav**: A navigation element.
* **Section**: A section of a document.
* **Header**: The header of a document.
* **Footer**: The footer of a document.
* **Article**: An article of text.

```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<section></section>
<article></article>
<footer></footer>
```


##New Elements!

Not so obvious HTML5 Elements.

* **Aside**: Describes content that is not the main content of a page.
* **Main**: Describes content that is the main content. (Maybe that's obvious)

```html
<main></main>
<aside></aside>
```



##Pseudo Class Selectors

* These are special selectors that specify a state or relation of an element.
* They begin with a colon, and are appended to a selector, or used on their own.


##Pseudo Class Selectors

States

```css
div:hover {
	background-color: #f00;
}
a:link {
	color: rgb(255, 27, 39);
}
a:visited {
	color: rgba(255, 27, 39, 0.5);
}
```


##Pseudo Class Selectors

Relations

```css
p.some-class:first-child {
	border-top: 20px solid #ccc;
}
p.some-class:last-child {
	border-bottom: 20px solid #ccc;
}
```



##Block Positioning

Static Positioning

* This is the default way elements are positioned.
* Elements render in order as they appear in the document.
* Position is determined by the position of the previous elements.
* We call this the "flow" of the document.
* Static elements affect the height of their parent.


##Block Positioning

Relative Positioning

* Start with the static position, then specify an offset.
* We do this using the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
* Relatively positioned elements remain the flow of the document.
* The offset doesn't affect the position of surrounding elements.
* They do affect the height of their parent, but the offset doesn't.

```css
img {
	position: relative;
	top: 10px;
	left: 10px;
}
```


##Block Positioning

Absolute Positioning

* With this we can specify an exact position for an element.
* Relative to what? Relative to the closest relatively positioned ancestor.
* This removes the element from the flow.
* They don't affect the position of other elements.
* They don't affect the height of their parent.

```css
.outer-container {
	position: relative;
}
.inner-element {
	position: absolute;
	bottom: 0px;
	right: 20px;
}
```


##Block Positioning

Fixed Positioning

* A fixed element doesn't move anywhere, even if you scroll.
* This is useful in specific situations, like a top nav bar.
* This removes the element from the flow just like absolute positioning.
* They don't affect the position of surrounding elements.
* They don't affect the height of their parent.

```css
nav {
	position: fixed;
}
```


##Block Positioning

Floats

* Start with static, then push it all the way to the right or the left.
* Text wraps around floated elements.
* Floating an element does partially remove it from the flow.
* Floated elements still affect the position of surrounding elements.
* But floated elements don't affect the height of thier parent.

```css
.rubber-ducky {
	float: left;
}
```


##Block Positioning

Floats

##Block Positioning

Clear

* We can also tell elements to sit below or clear floated elements.
* We can specify which floats we want to clear; `left`, `right`, `both`, or `none`.
* This becomes important because floats don't affect parent height.
* Cleared elements do affect the parent height.

```css
.heavy-rock {
	clear: both;
}
```


##Centering Elements Using Margins

* Sometimes we want to center an element inside it's parent.
* With text, we use `text-align: center` on the parent.
* With other elements we can use auto margins.

```css
.centered-content {
	/* The top and bottom margins don't 
	   have to be zero, in this case they are. */
	margin: 0 auto;
}
```
