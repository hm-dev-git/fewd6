##What you'll be able to do

* Describe JavaScript as a language.
* Evaluate expressions using primitive types.
* Assign the value of an expression to a variable.
* Implement conditional statements to add logic to your code.



#What is JavaScript?

* JavaScript is a programming language.
* It is executed in the browser.
* It can be used to modify the webpage after it is loaded.
* It's awesome


##JavaScript is like English

* Has grammatical rules called *syntax*.
* Has clauses, sentences, and paragraphs called expressions, statements, and blocks.
* Has verbs, adjectives, and nouns which can be keywords, operators, constants, or variables.
* Is read or interpreted left to write, top to bottom.
* Has punctuation and symbols that change meaning.
* Is used to reference abstract concepts.
* If you don't know it, it can be hard to understand.


##JavaScript is unique

* All statements are impertives or commands.
* A poem in JavaScript is a haiku, not an epic.
* JavaScript describes logic in a succinct way.
* Control flow changes the order in which code is executed.
* Relies heavily on symbols.
* You can write something valid, but almost unintelligable.



##Expressions and operators

* An expression is a bit of code that produces a value.
* Values come in many types, but the basic ones are called primitives.
	* number
	* string
	* boolean
	* null
	* undefined
* Operators are special symbols or words that modify expressions.


##Expressions with numbers

* A number in JavaScript can be an integer (whole number) or a float (decimal number).
* Operators for numbers include addition ( + ), multiplication ( * ), subtraction ( - ), and division ( / ).
* The following expressions use numbers and the plus operator:

```javascript
// An integer value: 1
1
```
```javascript
// Also an integer value: 2
1 + 1
```
```javascript
// A floating point value: 0.1
0.1
```
```javascript
// Also a floating point value: 1.1
0.1 + 1
```


##Expressions with strings

* A string is a value which represents text.
* Strings are surrounded by single or double quotes.
* We can combine or "concatenate" strings using the plus ( + ) operator.

```javascript
// A String value: Hello World!
'Hello World!'
```
```javascript
// Also a string value: Hello World!
'Hello ' + 'World!'
```
```javascript
// Also String value: 1
"1"
```
```javascript
// Also a string value: 1 is the loneliest number...
1 + ' is the loneliest number'
```


##Expressions with booleans

* A boolean has two possible values, true and false.
* We use booleans all over the place for determining what to do in different situations.
* We can combine booleans using the "or" ( || ) and "and" ( && ) operators.
* We can reverse the value of a boolean by using the not ( ! ) operator.

```javascript
// A boolean value: true
true
```
```javascript
// Also a boolean value: true
true || false
```
```javascript
// Also a boolean value: false
true && false
```
```javascript
// Also a boolean value: false
!true
```


##Expression with null

* null is a value that is sort of the opposite of every other value.
* We often use null to indicate that the value for something doesn't exist.

```javascript
// A null value (this is all you get for now).
null
```


##Expression with undefined

* undefined is the absence of a value.
* It's different from null, since null is actually a type of value.
* Things that are undefined are often the source of errors.

```javascript
// undefined (this is all you get for now).
undefined
```



##Statements

* A statement is a sentence in JavaScript.
* It defines a command issued to the browser.
* Statements are usually ended in semicolons.


##Variables

* A variable is a name given to a value.
* This allows you to refer to it later.
* We tell the browser that we are declaring a variable with the `var` keyword.
* We can assign the value of an expression to a variable using the single equals sign ( = ).

```javascript
var myNum = 1;
var myString = 'Hello ' + 'World!';
var myBool;
myBool = true && false;
```


##Global Variables

* What happens if you forget the `var` keyword?
* Without it, a global variable is created.
* If you don't mean to do it, bad things can happen.
* Always use `var`!


##Reassigning variables

* Any time after a variable is declared, you can modify its value.

```javascript
var foo = 1;
foo = foo + 1;
foo = 5;
```

##Conditional expressions

* Sometimes we want to check the relationship between two values.
* We do this using comparison operators.
* When we compare values in an expression, the result is a boolean

```
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = 'yes';
var d = 'yes';

// Equality
a !== b;
c === d;
// Relational operators
a < b;
b >= a;
```


##Conditional operators

##Conditional Statements

* By combining booleans with `if`/`else` statments, we can add logic to our code.
* Each statement defines a block of code to be executed if a condition is met.

```javascript
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

if (a > b) {
	alert('a is greater than b');
} else if (a === b) {
	alert('a and b are the same');
} else {
	alert('a is less than b');
}
```


##Multiple Conditions

* Because conditional expressions create boolean values, we can use boolean operators to combine them.

```javascript
var a = 1;
var b = 1;
var c = 3;
var d = 4;

if (c < d && a === b) {
	// Do something
}

if (c > d || a === b) {
	// Do something
}

if (c > d && (a === b || a < b)) {
	// Do something
}
```
